# Offline dev containers
## Background
When selecting a container image to use as a dev container, vscode will attempt to download the necassery executables to a container instance of that image. This will obviously fail in an environment without an internet connection like an airplane.

## Motivation
This tool allows the necassery executables to be pre-installed on the **image**.

## Use cases

The tool allows flexible usage. It is possible to bring the tarball that vscode will typically download yourself, To always use the latest version, or a specific vscode version.
Therefore it is possible to build devcontainer images as part of a CI pipeline, on an internet enabled computer to later be transferred to an isolated network with a specific version of vscode, or even before a flight to allow work to be done when internet is unavailable.

## A note on versions
A version comptability between the executables downloaded onto the container and vscode is necassery. That means that this script won't work with an image built using `--version 1.92.1` when vscode 1.92.2 is used, because it will attempt to install the executables matching version 1.92.2. You **must** ensure version comptability. When ran without `--verion` or `--commit`, the script will use the latest version available, and thus the latest version of vscode available during the image build will need to be used.
